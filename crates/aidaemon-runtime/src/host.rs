//! What the turn runtime asks of its host: a few cohesive traits the daemon's
//! agent implements, so the runtime's handlers run on any host that supplies
//! the same parts.
//!
//! - [`TurnStores`]: the conversation's durable state (dialogue state and the
//!   event log).
//! - [`TurnWorkspace`]: where the turn's file work happens (the execution
//!   backend and the configured project roots).
//! - [`DecisionRecorder`]: where the turn's decision points go.
